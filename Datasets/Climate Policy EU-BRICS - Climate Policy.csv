In this new Austrian Energy Efficiency Law, which is now already implemented and also in force, the national energy efficiency headline target - the Austrian final energy consumption must not exceed 1.050 PJ in 2020 - is set out.
Austria will reach this target by:
a bundle of measures which can be divided into the categories industrial buildings, production and services as well as trade and small-scale consumption, mobility, energy provision, security of energy supply and general measures as well as by
an obligation system.
As of 1st January 2015, all energy suppliers (with the exception of very small businesses) must implement demonstrable measures to increase energy efficiency to reach a target of 0.6% annual increase in energy efficiency (energy savings obligation system).

The new renewable energy law establishes more ambitious national renewable energy targets that should reach 20% of total national energy consumption and 40% of total electricity consumption by 2020. Moreover, 20% of energy used in heating and cooling and 10% of energy used in transportation have to come from renewable sources. The new legislation foresees the creation of a Special Renewable Energy Investment Service that will act as an interface between public institutions and investors, annually assess the main challenges to renewable energy deployment and manage the support funding allocation process. Existing remuneration of individual residents in areas where renewable energy projects are running have been amended and replaced by a credit on electricity bills. In fact, the law establishes that a share of the RE concession taxes paid by RE producers to regional and local authorities will will be allocated to local households as a credit on their electricity bill as a way to share the benefits of living nearby a renewable energy generation plant. The renewable energy generation licensing process has also been very much fasten and eased by the regulation that entitles the Regulatory Authority for Energy (RAE) with the assessment and issuance of licences, under the authority of the ministry of Environment, Energy and Climate Change. The whole licensing process can not last over a 30-month period. Moreover, absolute priority is given to RES projects combined with desalination plants, when and only when the RES project is on an island and its capacity does not exceed 25% of the capacity of the desalination plant. The law also tackles the grid infrastructure challenge and implements a timely limited target for the grid utility to connect non-interconnected islands to the main grid. Still, RE projects are not granted grid priority access as grid connection will be established on a first-come first served basis until the network is saturated. The grid utility is compelled to provide grid access within four months after the connection demand has been released. The Law 3851 also establishes a whole new set of feed-in tariffs for electricity from renewable sources, to be found in the Greek FIT article.

The report stresses the need to ensure sustainable development and to set up a medium-term plan. The report recommends six categories of actions:
To ensure that electricity from renewable energies will amount to at least 10% of final electricity consumption by 2010;
To improve energy efficiency in energy generation;
To increase energy savings;
To set an eco-tax progressively;
To curb the increase in road transport;
To rely on flexible mechanism allowed by Kyoto Protocol.

This body will allow for electricity reselling destined to electric vehicle charging. 2) Super off-peak hourly discrimination addressed to electric vehicle charging: In general, the off-peak hours slow charging of electric vehicles, typically taking place over-night, will contribute to the harmonization of both daily curves, namely electricity demand, and its associated generation. This will result in a more efficient use of electricity infrastructures and a maximization of non-manageable renewable energy integration.

It covers two five-year periods: 2017-2022 and 2022-2027.
The NEP projects electricity demand and supply planning until the fiscal year 2026/27. It has a cumulative target of 175 GW renewable energy capacity by 2022. The NEP foresees coal-fired power capacity additions of 46 GW between 2022 and 2027.
""It is expected that the share of non-fossil based installed capacity (Nuclear + Hydro + Renewable Sources) will increase to 46.8 % by the end of 2021-22 and will further increase to 56.5 % by the end of 2026-27 considering capacity addition of 50,025 MW coal based capacity already under construction and likely to yield benefits during 2017-
22 and no coal based capacity addition during 2022-27."" (http://www.cea.nic.in/reports/committee/nep/nep_dec.pdf)
It implies that no new coal-fired power plants are necessary beyond those already under construction (Carbon Brief, 2017), and further calls of 57% of electric capacity to be non-fossil by 2027 (Carbon Brief, 2017).
Other targets: Renewable energy generation share of 20% by 2022; Renewable energy generation share of 24% by 2027.
Renewable energy sector is now poised for a quantum jump as India has reset its renewable energy capacity addition target so as to have an installed capacity of 175 GW (100GW solar, 60GW wind, 10GW biomass and 5GW small-hydro) by 2022, in view of the significant renewable energy potential in the country and commitment made by the investors/stakeholders.

The country projects the BAU scenario to reach 310MtCO2 in 2030. The country  aims to reduce 23.5% by 2030, relative to the BAU scenario (UAE NDC, 2020).
The NDC sets for the electricity sector a goal of 50% share of clean energy (renewables and nuclear) in the installed power capacity mix by 2050, since UAE is investing in solar energy and nuclear energy. UAE is on track to reach 14 gigawatts (GW) by 2030. A grid-based clean power, distributed electricity generation, rooftop solar photovoltaic in particular, is being promoted in the Emirate of Dubai. As a last strategy, regulatory measures and technology deployment are envisioned to increase efficiency of energy consumption with an end goal to reduce it by 40% by 2050 with periodic tariff reforms.
In the building sector, codes and standards are the main instrument, with green building regulations and rating schemes for new buildings. Standards and labels may enable informed consumer choices, thus UAE has established an Energy Efficiency Standardization and Labelling Program which covers a range of household goods and appliances. The approach for the industry sector is based on voluntary targets of carbon usage reduction and looking at the transport one a fuel pricing reform (international prices for gasoline, quality standards for fuel and motor and stimulation of a sustainable transport (shifting transport modals for a public one or electric cars) are the strategy disclosed.
CAT calculates the new target to be 246MtCO2 and highly insufficient  and emphasises that there is no mention of net-zero target (Climate Action Tracker, 2021).

The forest concession in public forests in Brazil started to be legally handled through the ""Law for the Management of Public Forests"". The costly forest concession, through the payment for the sustainable use of forest products and services, is a way of indirect management that can be applied to National Forests and other types of public forests which are not designated to community use or protected areas of ""full protection"" category. Thus allowing federal, state and local governments to grant to private actors the right to sustainably exploit the goods and services present in public forests. It is worth highlighting the fact that this law does not allow the commercialization of carbon credits and other environmental services by the owner of the concession, as explained in art. 16, 1st paragraph of section VI.
The Brazilian government currently implements a concession policy to exploit timber harvesting on national forestry reserves. The law creates a Brazilian Forest Service, sets up a National Forest Development Fund and puts into effect an infrastructure for sustainable use of public lands (including the use of concessions). The law aims to strengthen forest conservation (especially in the
Amazon) by decreasing land speculation, putting an end to fraudulent property claims (grilagem) and creating a socially inclusive, sustainable forest-based economy. The GoB estimates that approximately 13 million hectares in the Amazon will be opened to public use over the first 10 years of the plan.","Non-energy use, Energy service demand reduction and resource efficiency, Energy efficiency, Renewables, Other low-carbon technologies and fuel switch",,In force,2006,,,19,Unknown,Mitigation,http://www2.camara.leg.br/legin/fed/lei/2006/lei-11284-2-marco-2006-541235-norma-pl.html,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,,1,1,1,1,1,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

The ETS will start with the electricity sector covering around 3.5 Gt CO2 emissions (Stavins, 2017) and is expected to start in 2020 (China Carbon Forum, 2017). After that, gradually other industry sectors, such as cement, steel, petroleum refining and chemicals will be added to the program. The ETS targets is not an absolute emissions gap, but a rate based (CO2/Kwh) cap that is set per category per sector. The rate is based on historical trends and technology benchmarks (Stavins, 2017). For example, coal-fired power plants are expected to have different rates, than gas-fired power plants. In the beginning, the permits of this scheme will be grandfathered to the firms, in this case plants emitting more than 26,000 tonnes of CO2 per year (Carbon Brief, 2017).","Energy service demand reduction and resource efficiency, Energy efficiency, Renewables, Other low-carbon technologies and fuel switch",,In force,2020,2020,,5,High,Mitigation,"https://chinaenergyportal.org/en/national-carbon-emissions-trading-market-establishment-program-power-generation-industry/ http://www.chinacarbon.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/2017-China-Carbon-Pricing-Survey.pdf

It is overseen by the UAE Council on Climate Change and the Environment.
The Plan is designed as a framework for all mitigation and adaptation efforts across the country. It builds on the UAE Vision 2021 and the UAE Green Agenda 2015-2030, along with other federal and emirate-level strategies.
To achieve these objectives, the National Climate Change Plan defines three priorities:
• Developing a national GHG emissions management system, whose objective is to establish an economy-wide emission reduction target by 2020.
• Fostering national adaptation planning ;
• Providing a private sector-driven innovative diversification Program.
Several means of implementation are also considered in the plan:
- Climate Finance,
- Capacity Building,
- Governance, Monitoring and Evaluation,
- Awareness Raising and Communications,
- International Cooperation.

One of the aims of the plan with regard to air pollution is to maintain acceptable air quality levels for 80% of the year by 2020. As an action towards achieving air quality improvements, China aims to remove 4 million high-emissions vehicles that are currently on the roads. Subsidies and tax breaks to support new technologies are already in place and will continue to be.

This specific subsidy will be sufficient to attain the minimum level required to cover the investment and operating costs that these technologies cannot recover in the market and may enable them to obtain a suitable return.

 1. Direct access for new, totally rebuilt, reactivated or repowered/upgraded plants with a capacity not exceeding a given limit (art. 4, paragraph 3) and using specific types of sources or for special projects;
2. Enrolment into the Registries for new, totally rebuilt, reactivated or repowered/upgraded and renovated plants
3. Awarding of incentives after participation in a competitive Dutch auctions (electronic auctions held by GSE) for new, totally rebuilt, reactivated or repowered/upgraded plants: the capacity of these plants shall exceed a given threshold (5 MW).
To determine the way of access to the incentives for renovated plants, the capacity to be considered corresponds to the increase in capacity obtained as a result of the project.
The total maximum new installed capacity that could be awarded to all technologies through both registries and auctions is 1.370 MW of which 800 MW for new onshore wind capacity.

Regarding long-term strategy, from 2021 onwards Brazil states it requires US$ 10 billion per year to realize environmental pledges, including conservation of native vegetation and states that the function of market mechanisms is paramount to achieve carbon neutrality earlier than 2060.
According to CAT, the Brazilian updated NDC is weaker than the previous one, being rated 'Highly insufficient"". The CAT shows that an increase in the emissions used as reference data allows Brazil to increase its emissions over than 400 MtCO2e still meeting the relative proposed target (1,453 MtCO2e in 2025 and 1,307 in 2030).
Another rollback is the removal of explicit sectoral mitigation targets, especially those related to halt illegal deforestation in the Amazon.","Energy efficiency, Energy service demand reduction and resource efficiency, Non-energy use, Other low-carbon technologies and fuel switch, Renewables",,Superseded,2020,2021,2030,FALSE,Unknown,"Adaptation, Mitigation","https://www4.unfccc.int/sites/ndcstaging/PublishedDocuments/Brazil%20First/Brazil%20First%20NDC%20(Updated%20submission).pdf

The Integrated Climate and Energy Policy specifies targets for reducing GHG emissions and provides a joint action plan to achieve emission reductions. The climate tax package changes to different taxes and subsidies (2MtCO2e by 2020) to balance future increases in energy and environmental taxes for enterprises and households against equivalent tax concessions, allows for a tax exemption for green cars (emissions of less than 120g of CO2/km) from vehicle tax. Furthermore the bill contains a carbon tax, which increases for heating in industry outside the scope of EU ETS such as agriculture, forestry and aquaculture (30% in 2011, 60% in 2015) and reduces the carbon tax rebate for diesel. It also facilitates green investments in developing countries, climate policy and development co-operation and an increased focus on climate change adaptation (responsibility to co-ordinate climate adaptation is given to country administrative boards; adapt spatial planning to increased risks of landslides; research on how climate change affects the loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services and how negative effects can be limited).
The Integrated Climate and Energy Policy also contains action plans to promote renewable energy, improve energy efficiency and implement measures leading to a fossil-independent transportation sector.
Targets outlined in this legislation include:
– 40% GHGs from non-ETS sectors by 2020 (compared to 1990 levels)
– 50% of energy consumption from renewable energy by 2020
– 20% more efficient energy use (compared to 2008)
– 10% renewable energy in the transportation sector
– by 2020: a phase out of fossil fuels in heating
– by 2030: a vehicle fleet that is independent of fossil fuels
– by 2050: zero net emissions of GHGs in Sweden.","Energy service demand reduction and resource efficiency, Energy efficiency, Renewables, Other low-carbon technologies and fuel switch, Non-energy use",,In force,2009,,,16,Unknown,"Mitigation, Adaptation",http://www.lse.ac.uk/GranthamInstitute/law/an-integrated-climate-and-energy-policy-outlined-in-government-bills-200809-162-and-200809-163/,,,,,,,,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,0,0,0,1,0,0,,1,1,1,1,1,0,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

The objective of the PIMA Air Plan was to reduce CO2‚ and NOx‚ emission and particle pollution by subsidies for renovating the commercial vehicle fleets. The main beneficiaries of this initiative were self-employed professionals and businesses, who will be encouraged to replace their old light commercial vehicles with more efficient. The Plan established the rules for the direct aid for the purchase of new and used vehicles (up to one year old) up to 3.5 tonnes maximum authorized weight. The amount of aid amounted to EUR 1 000‚ per vehicle, for vehicles of weight less than 2 500 kg and EUR 2 000€‚ for vehicles of weight over 2 500 kg. Since October 25th, 2013, electric motorcycles, scooters, and bikes were also included to this incentives program (“Plan PIMA Air 2”), with incentives up to 400 EUR, 250 EUR, and 200 EUR respectively per category. Incentives of Plan PIMA Air can be added to the MOVELE Program incentives, but not to the PIVE Program. During 2014, the third edition of the PIMA Air program (“PIMA Air 3”) was running, funded with a budget of 5.5 million EUR, and a number of 2,671 commercial vehicles were renewed and a number of 2,468 electric bicycles were acquired in this frame.

The Law introduces several development schemes for the private development of renewable energy projects, including competitive bids, feed-in tariff, and independent power production through third party access.
Competitive bidding to be run by the New and Renewable Energy Authority (“NREA”) open to private sector companies for construction of the renewable power projects. Constructed stations will be operated by NREA. Produced electricity will be sold to Egyptian Electricity Transmission Company (EETC) at a regulated price determined by Egyptian Electric Utility and Consumer Protection Regulatory Agency (ERA).
Competitive bidding mechanism for build-own-operate (BOO) contracts to be run by EETC and open to private companies for construction, ownership and operation of the renewable power projects. Generated electricity will be sold to EETC on the price agreed between EETC and plant owner.
Feed-in tariff (FIT) support system under which private sector investors are allowed to build, own and operate renewable energy power stations and sell generated electricity to EETC or to licensed distribution companies via power purchase agreements (PPA). PPA determines duration of the contract and a fix electricity price (feed-in tariff). PPA for feed-in tariffs for solar installations will last 20 years, for wind projects 25 years. Egypt aims to deploy 4300 MW of new renewable capacity under FIT scheme between 2015 and 2017. FIT system is open only for solar PV and wind technologies.
Independent power production through third party access scheme allows independent power producers (IPP) to enter bilateral electricity purchase contracts with eligible consumers and sell them produced electricity directly. EETC must allow for conclusion of such contract and make grid network available. In this case, EETC is allowed to charge and collect greed access fee for grid usage.",Renewables,,In force,2015,,,10,High,Mitigation,https://thelawreviews.co.uk/edition/the-renewable-energy-law-review-edition-3/1229892/egypt,,,,,,,,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,,,0,0,1,0,0,0,,0,0,0,0,1,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Some of the main actions envisioned in the Doctrine are setting a price on carbon, and enhancing energy efficiency and the expansion of renewables and alternative energy sources.
The new version of the Doctrine from October 2023 deletes the statement that the human influence on climate change is mainly linked to emissions, particularly from the burning of fossil fuels.
The energy targets presented in the Doctrine are: to reduce the share of energy generated from natural gas to 46% or 47% by 2030 (from more than 50% currently); doubling the capacity of nuclear power plants; increase the share of electricity produced from renewables to 1.5% by 2010, 2.5% by 2015 and 4.5% by 2020; and limit the burning of gas produced from oil wells. RE target of 1.5% by 2010, 2.5% by 2015 and 4.5% by 2020 was superseded in 2014 by the State Program on Energy efficiency and Energy Development. Followed by the Comprehensive Plan for Implementation of the Climate Doctrine to 2020.
National, regional and local authorities are responsible for producing and implementing action plans that are in line with the Doctrine, creating fiscal and financial incentives for the development and deployment of technologies that enhance energy efficiency, and lead to adaptation to and mitigation of climate change. Furthermore, the responsibility to adopt measures that lead to energy efficiency in vehicles, building, services and the production of heat and electricity rest with the enterprises themselves.

The plan seeks to improve energy efficiency and cut greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by developing renewable energy and expanding nuclear power capacity. The plan aims to cut energy consumption per unit of GDP by 3-5% per year. It also aims at increasing the share of renewable energy to 16% by 2030, and transport fuel from alternative sources such as gas or biofuels to 20% by 2020. The plan contains data on the greenhouse gas emissions in the Czech Republic, including projections of future development, and presents proposals for concrete measures to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions and for adaptation measures. The programme was reviewed in 2007, and the review adopted by the government in April 2008. The review pointed to significant increase in the use of renewable energy sources, as well as progress in the agriculture and water management sectors. However, it found the Czech Republics energy intensity and GHG emissions per capita were comparatively high, and that transport sector emissions continued to increase. The National Climate Change Plan is thus being reviewed to emphasise measures targeting the industry and transport sectors, which contribute the most to GHG emissions, as well as to take into account the evolution of domestic, European and global political negotiations on climate change since 2004.

The following metrics should be used to gauge progress toward these objectives in the 2030 perspective: (I) a maximum 56% share of coal-fired power generation (with a conservatively estimated exit date of 2049); (II) a minimum 23% share of renewable electricity in final consumption (32% in power generation, 14% in transport); (III) the addition of nuclear power generation by 2033; (IV) a reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of 30% (compared to 1990 levels); and (V)

The National Research Strategy, first formed in 2007 and amended in 2016, served as the framework under which the strategy was developed. The National Strategy for Energy Research's original goal is to promote research on prominent energy issues with significant economic and social repercussions.

In a first step to completely phase out fossil fuels the government targets the drop in the consumption of oil, gas and coal by 33% between 2009 and 2020.
The share of thermal production in total energy generation should also decrease from 71% to 40% over the same period.
To reach 100% of electricity from renewable, the Danish government greatly focuses on wind energy, expected to provide for 40% of total electricity needs, together with biomass and biogas. A solid district heating network, fed by renewable heat from biomass, will be the main motor of the energy transition in the heating sector.
Full independence from fossil fuels will also be reached through a solid and long term energy efficiency policy aiming at reducing gross energy consumption by 6% from 2006 levels. Energy companies will be required to increase energy savings by 50% in 2013 and 75% by 2017 to 2020. Electric meters diffusion will participate in moniotring energy demand in the residential sector.
In the building sector, the Danish government is going a step forward in implementing very ambitious building code, banning oil boilers in all new constructions and, by 2017, in all houses while biomass, biogas and solar thermal appliances will be strongly encouraged.
Denmark also targets the large scale deployment of offshore wind as well as dramatic growth in the wind manufacturing sector, and will fund research and development in for solar and wave power, support main demonstration projects for large heat pumps intended to be used in district heating plants and fund other geothermal energy research projects.
In order to generate revenues to finance the energy shift of the country, Denmark will introduce a public service obligation tax on electricity and gas, while tax on oil, gas and coal will be further increased to discourage their use.

Regulates area targets for designating wind energy areas, aiming for 1.4% of the federal area by the end of 2027 and 2% by the end of 2032.
Amendment to the Federal Nature Conservation Act (BNatSchG):
Aims to streamline the approval process for wind turbines while maintaining high environmental standards.
Recognizes wind turbine operation as being in the public interest, facilitating exemptions.
Simplifies the assessment of species protection exceptions and alternatives, particularly for repowering onshore wind turbines.
Amendment of the Building Energy Act (GEG):
Introduces mandatory requirements for installing climate-friendly heating systems in new homes, with at least 65% powered by renewable energy starting January 2024.
Allows existing heating systems to continue use with transition periods and exemptions.
Provides social compensation payments and a KfW subsidy program.
These amendments collectively aim to bridge the climate protection gap by up to 80%, aligning with Germany's climate targets and commitments under international agreements like the Paris Agreement.","Energy efficiency, Energy service demand reduction and resource efficiency, Non-energy use, Other low-carbon technologies and fuel switch, Renewables",,In force,2023,,2032,2,,Mitigation,"https://www.bmwk.de/Redaktion/DE/Downloads/klimaschutz/20231004-klimaschutzprogramm-der-bundesregierung.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&v=10

The law was designed to stimulate the market for renewable, clean burning fuel.
The B2 biodiesel requirement went into effect and became mandatory as of 1 January 2008. While in 2007 many gas stations began offering B2 biodiesel, all stations now offer only B2 biodiesel. The requirement was modified in March 2008, and as of 1 July 2008, the requirement is that all diesel contain 3% rather than 2% biofuel (B3 biodiesel).
The mandatory biodiesel blending content was increased as of July 2009 to 4%, and further to 5% (B5 biodiesel) as of January 2010. The B5 biodiesel requirement is being implemented three years ahead of its scheduled implementation date of 2012 as per the 2005 law.
In May 2014 the the mandatory biodiesel blending content was increased to 5% starting from 1st of Jul and 7% from 1st November 2014.
On 24th of March 2016 Law No 13.263 increased mandatory biodiesel blend target to 8% starting from March 2017 to 9% from March 2018 and to 10% from March 2019.

By the end of the Strategy third implementation phase, the proportion of Eastern energy markets in the Russian energy export of liquid hydrocarbons (oil and oil products) should grow from the current 6 to 22–25%, while natural gas export should grow from 0 to 19–20%. The Strategy sets a 56 percent energy intensity reduction target for 2030 (compared with 2005). It will be accomplished in three stages: the first is a major overhaul of the energy sector; the second emphasizes efficiency gains through new technology within the fuel and energy sectors; and the third stresses economy-wide energy efficiency.

The estimate of savings induced by PNAEE 2016 is 1501 ktoe, corresponding to a reduction of energy consumption of approximately 8.2% relative to the average consumption in the period between 2001 and 2005, which approximates the indicative target set by the European Union of 9% energy savings by 2016.

The chemicals sector accounts for 25% of total emissions of the industrial sector.
The Ministry of Ecological Transition published a Decarbonation Roadmap for the chemicals sector. It highlights the progress made in the sector, its future needs and emissions, and the ways for the sector to reduce its carbon emissions. It sets a new emissions reduction target of 26% by 2030, compared to 2015. The goals highlighted in the roadmap are:
- enhancing energy efficiency (reducing annual GHG emissions by 1.8 MtCO2 equivalent between 2015 and 2030);
- nitrous oxide (N2O) reduction (-0.8 MtCO2 eq)
- lowering emissions of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) (-0.9 MtCO2 eq).
- generating low-carbon heat (1.4 MtCO2 equivalent for heat from biomass and -0.8 MtCO2 equivalent for heat from Solid Recovered Fuel - SRF).
The plan advocates the use of several measures to guarantee affordable and dependable supply to low-carbon electricity while offering rewards for energy conservation, such as:
- Instruments to facilitate an industry-wide supply of competitive low-carbon energy; 
- Extending and protecting the public electricity network's interruptibility and rate-reduction measures; 
- Implementing compensation for the ETS scheme's indirect costs between 2021 and 2030; and
- Promoting an energy tax structure that will increase electrification.","Energy efficiency, Energy service demand reduction and resource efficiency, Non-energy use, Other low-carbon technologies and fuel switch, Renewables",,In force,2021,,,4,,Mitigation,https://www.iea.org/policies/13516-decarbonisation-roadmap-for-the-chemicals-sector,26/02/2024,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,0,0,0,1,0,0,,1,1,1,1,1,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

By increasing the availability of debt financing and improving the capacity of institutions, it will expand uptake of GRPV in the country. The program addresses the barriers to accelerated GRPV installation. It also allows the consumer to internalize the positive environmental externalities of solar power and thus encourages GRPV installation.

Croatian National Energy Strategy 2009-2020 has three basic objectives: 1) increase security of energy supply, 2) develop competitive energy system and 3) ensure sustainable energy sector development. These objectives are particularly important due to Croatia’s heavy dependence on energy imports which results in country’s vulnerability to energy prices volatilities.
Targets:
- decrease by 20% greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 taking emissions level of 1990 as a baseline;
- increase share of renewable energy by 20% in annual gross energy consumption of the country by 2020;
- cover 10% of energy consumption in all transport sector with energy derived from renewable sources by 2020;
- decrease final energy consumption by 9% by 2016.

The Loi relative à la transition énergétique pour la croissance verte (Energy transition for green growth law), a national framework strategy for 2015, incorporates the policy. Additionally, it is an endeavor to control and promote a circular economy. Minerals are one of the natural resources covered in the Resources for France plan. Despite not being a large producer of essential minerals, France has recognized since the 2010s that its needs are growing due to the energy transition and the digitalization. The strategy includes essential minerals because France is heavily dependent on imports.
The Comité pour les métaux stratégiques (COMES) and the Bureau de recherches géologiques et minières (BRGM) are tasked with doing a more thorough mapping of the requirements for essential minerals in relation to the energy transition. 
The strategy also emphasizes recycling as a viable production technique for industrialized nations like France. It urges further investigation into secondary mineral resources.
The proposal also suggests incorporating sustainability standards into the chain of production for vital minerals. Reusing and recycling are viewed as an alternate method to guarantee a local, sustainable supply. The strategy does, however, draw attention to the necessity of a European initiative on social and environmental standards for mining.
The circular economy is supported by policy in part thanks to this five-year strategy. It takes into account the social and environmental effects of key minerals in addition to their economic and security repercussions. This strategy is being developed simultaneously at the national and regional levels; some of the goals outlined in the Resources for France plan are also included in the European Commission's adopted 2020 Circular Economy Action Plan. On December 10, 2020, a proposal for regulating of batteries and their minerals was made.","Energy efficiency, Energy service demand reduction and resource efficiency, Non-energy use, Other low-carbon technologies and fuel switch, Renewables",,Ended,2018,,,FALSE,,Mitigation,https://www.iea.org/policies/15650-resources-for-france-plan,26/02/2024,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,0,0,0,1,0,0,,1,1,1,1,1,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

In agriculture, the SNBC aims to achieve a 12% reduction in emissions through the implementation of the agroecology project. This will involve methanisation, ground cover, maintaining pastureland, developing the agroforestry sector and optimising the use of inputs. In the industrial sector, the SNBC aims to achieve a 24% emissions reduction, notably by improving energy efficiency, which is also a source of competitiveness, growing the circular economy (reuse, recycling, energy recovery, etc.) and replacing fossil fuels with renewable energy sources.

In reaction to a decision by the Federal Constitutional Court, the change was made. With the new climate targets, Germany contributes to the larger European ambition to become the first continent to be carbon neutral and wants to support international efforts to achieve the goals of the Paris Climate Agreement by setting the new EU climate targets at the national level.
At least -65% by 2030, compared to 1990 levels, and at least -88% by 2040, compared to 1990 levels, are the new GHG emission reduction targets established by the Act. GHG neutrality by 2045 (instead of 2050).
New benchmarks are established: 
- Raise sector-specific annual reduction objectives from 2023 to 2030.
- Pass legislation establishing yearly reduction goals for the years 2031 to 2040.
- By 2024, define the sector-specific annual reduction targets for the years 2031 to 2040.
Determine annual reduction goals for the years 2041–2045 by 2032.
- By 2034, identify sector-specific annual reduction objectives to achieve climate neutrality between 2041 and 2045. 
The Energy and Climate Fund (Energie- und Klimafonds) is the primary financial source providing resources to carry out the climate protection act.
The German Bundestag approved a revised Federal Climate Change Act on June 24, 2021. The Cabinet also approved an immediate action plan to help reach these new goals, allocating an additional EUR 8 billion for climate protection initiatives across all sectors between 2022 and 2025.

1. Invest more and better in public transport;
2. Facilitate and promote the development of solutions to enable all citizens to access transportation services;
3. Initiate the transition towards cleaner mobility.
Key initiatives within this third pillars are: reach carbon neutrality in the transport sector to contribute to making France carbon neutral by 2050 (including 37.5% CO2 emissions reductions by 2030 and the ban on the sale of fossil fuel ICE cars by 2040 - art. 73); develop charging infrastructure for EVs; develop incentives for bike mobility and car pooling; create low emission zones to improve air quality; create an ecotax on aviation; reduction of 2 cents of the exemption of Domestic Tax on Consumption of Energy Products (TICPE) for trucks.

The main measures are: 1) As of January 1st 2011, electricity generators from both special and ordinary regimes will be required to pay a fee of a value equal to EUR 0.50/MWh for electricity fed into the grid. 2) As already witnessed for wind and thermal power installations, the number of equivalent hours of solar photovolatic generated electricity eligible for government support is limited. Once that limit is reached, the excess electricity generated by that particular installation during that particular year will not be supported and will be sold at the wholesale electricity market price.

The Plan’s objective is to prepare the country’s industry for the new future scenario that is emerging in the horizon, in which carbon productivity, equivalent to the intensity of greenhouse gas emissions per product unit, will be as important as work productivity and other productive factors in defining the international competitiveness of Brazilian industry. In order to do that, it will be necessary to establish management systems for the greenhouse gas emission of the industrial sector as tools to improve competitiveness, in a process similar to the implementation of environmental management systems in the past.
“The design and implementation of the sector plan is based on the rules established by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and do not affect the ongoing validity of such rules, including the commitment with international financial and technological support for the actions of countries not included in Annex and flexibilities for them with regard to measurement, communication and verification of emissions and emission reductions.
“The Industry Plan is based on three pillars:
(i) Gradual implementation of a measurement, reporting and verification system (MRV) for the emission of greenhouse gases produced by industrial activities.
(ii) Action Plan with a set of measures and instruments to encourage emission reductions.
(iii) Creation of an Industry Plan Technical Commission (CTPIn) comprising representatives of the government, industry, civil society and academia, responsible for detailing the Plan’s actions, monitoring and periodical reviews.
“The Industry Plan adopts as reference a 5% reduction target for emissions in industrial processes and energy use in the industrial sector, in relation to the trend scenario (Business As Usual) projected for 2020. The target’s role is to stimulate improvements to the efficiency of industrial processes and not to hinder economic growth.”
